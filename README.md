## Testing

Testing was done constantly before and after pushing new changes to the master branch. However, the biggest issue that I encountered by myself and with my mentor was:

- Responsive Design - The whole page was not as responsive as I thought, but now its viewable on any device.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

- [Index Page HTML](docs/home.png)
- [About Us Page HTML](docs/about.png)
- [Team Page HTML](docs/team.png)
- [style.css CSS](docs/stylescss.png)
